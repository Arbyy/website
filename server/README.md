# Getting Started

## Downloads

Download Node.js.

In the command line, navigate to this directory and type `npm install` to install all project dependencies.

## Development server

Run `nodemon server.js` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3002/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Note that you can also run the server using `node server.js`, but it will not automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running tests

Run `npm test` to execute the tests via [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).
